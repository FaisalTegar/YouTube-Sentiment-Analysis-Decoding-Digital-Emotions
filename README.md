## 📌 Project Overview
As a Communication Science graduate transitioning into Data Science, I bridges the gap between human interaction and machine intelligence. This project analyzes over **17,000 YouTube comments** to classify audience sentiment into Positive, Neutral, and Negative categories.

By leveraging **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**, this tool helps creators and brands automate community management and derive actionable content strategies.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.11
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, NLTK, Emoji, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Model:** Tuned Random Forest Classifier (GridSearchCV)
- **Vectorization:** TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)

## 📊 Key Results
- **Model Accuracy:** 75.98%
- **Sentiment Distribution:** 68% Positive, 24% Neutral, 8% Negative.
- **Top Predictors:** Gratitude-based tokens ("love", "thank", "great") are the strongest drivers of positive engagement.
